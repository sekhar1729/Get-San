# Get-San
GetSAN is a cybersecurity-focused project designed to extract Subject Alternative Names (SANs) from SSL/TLS certificates of domain names. It is being enhanced into a major project by integrating a Flask-based API with a web-based dashboard to provide an interactive and efficient way to retrieve SANs for security analysis
